# Code club murder mystery

Welcome to the code club murder mystery! These are a set of exercises that are geared towards helping you learn to solve common bugs. These will encompass exercises in `R` - such as `tidyverse`, `ggplot`, and base R errors and exercises using `snakemake`.

To start, download this whole repository to your own computer. In your terminal run:

```
git clone https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery.git
```

A new folder will appear called `code_club_murder_mystery`. All of the exercises you need to run are in this folder.

Thank you to [claude.ai](claude.ai) for providing the names and code for exercises 1 - 5.

## Exercise 1 The case of the misisng error
To start, open `R` and install `tidyverse` if it isn't already installed

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Then open the file [exercises/exercise1_tidyverse_select.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise1_tidyverse_select.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through solving the error.

## Exercise 2 The Filter Fiasco
This exercise still uses R with `tidyverse` so your previous R session will still work.

Open the file [exercises/exercise2_tidyverse_filter.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise2_tidyverse_filter.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.

## Exercise 3 The group by ghost
This exercise still uses R with `tidyverse` so your previous R session will still work.

Open the file [exercises/exercise3_tidyverse_group.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise3_tidyverse_group.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.

## Exercise 4 The pipeline puzzle
This exercise still uses R with `tidyverse` so your previous R session will still work.

Open the file [exercises/exercise4_tidyverse_pipe.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise4_tidyverse_pipe.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.

Open the file [exercises/exercise7_R_scope.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise7_R_scope.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.

## Exercise 8 The Invisible NA
This exercise uses base R so your previous R session will still work.

Open the file [exercises/exercise8_R_NA.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise8_R_NA.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.

## Exercise 9 The Cursed Condition
This exercise uses base R so your previous R session will still work.

Open the file [exercises/exercise9_R_conditions.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise9_R_conditions.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.

## Exercise 10 The Unsorted Alibi
This exercise uses base R so your previous R session will still work.

Open the file [exercises/exercise10_R_vectors.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise10_R_vectors.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.

## Exercise 11 The Missing Layers
This exercise uses R with `ggplot2` so your previous R session will still work.

Open the file [exercises/exercise11_ggplot_layers.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise11_ggplot_layers.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.

## Exercise 12 The Overlapping Clue
This exercise uses R with `ggplot2` so your previous R session will still work.

Open the file [exercises/exercise12_ggplot_color.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise12_ggplot_color.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through this error.
