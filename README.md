## Exercise 1 The case of the misisng error
To start, open `R` and install `tidyverse` if it isn't already installed

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Then open the file [exercises/tidyverse_select.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/tidyverse_select.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through solving the error.
