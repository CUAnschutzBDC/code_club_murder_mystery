# Code club murder mystery

Welcome to the code club murder mystery! These are a set of exercises that are geared towards helping you learn to solve common bugs. These will encompass exercises in `R` - such as `tidyverse`, `ggplot`, and base R errors and exercises using `snakemake`.

To start, download this whole repository to your own computer. In your terminal run:

```
git clone https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery.git
```

A new folder will appear called `code_club_murder_mystery`. All of the exercises you need to run are in this folder.

Thank you to [claude.ai](claude.ai) for providing the names and code for exercises 1 - 5.

## Exercise 1 The case of the misisng error
To start, open `R` and install `tidyverse` if it isn't already installed

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Then open the file [exercises/exercise1_tidyverse_select.R](https://github.com/CUAnschutzBDC/code_club_murder_mystery/blob/main/exercises/exercise1_tidyverse_select.R) and run the code. An error will show up. Work through solving the error.

## Exercise 2 The Filter Fiasco
