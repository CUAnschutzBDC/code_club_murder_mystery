Welcome to the code club murder mystery! These are a set of exercises that are geared towards helping you learn to solve common bugs. These will encompass exercises in `R` - such as `tidyverse`, `ggplot`, and base R errors and exercises using `snakemake`.

## Exercise 1 The case of the misisng error
